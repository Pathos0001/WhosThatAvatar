# WhosThatAvatar
Find and view public VRChat avatars

## How To Use
Every avatar is identified with a unique ID, which usually starts with avtr_
### Load an avatar from an avatar ID
Type the id in the search bar at the top of the application.
To copy and paste in the web application, as WebGL does not support copy and paste, after the web address, set the avatar querystring to the avatar ID you want to find. After "Avatar=" add the avatar ID. E.g http://whosthatavatar.com/?avatar=avtr_63340186-53cb-46e3-9a60-419da084c794
